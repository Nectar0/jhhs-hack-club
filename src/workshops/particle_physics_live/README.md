# Particle Physics Live Workshop

In this workshop, you're going to use **p5.js**, along with ðŸŒŸ PHYSICS ðŸŒŸ, to animate colorful particles. Along the way, you'll learn a little bit about:

- how to use p5.js
- some basic physics concepts
- how *fun* creative coding is

All of the different particles will act like planets in orbit. They'll all apply forces (gravity) to each other depending on their mass and their distance from each other. 

- The main difference here is that they are much closer together than real planets. This is so you don't have to wait an entire year for one particle to orbit another.

**When you are done with this workshop, you should end up with something similar to this!**

ðŸ•œ This workshop will take 1 meetup

ðŸ’» This workshop requiresÂ **zero coding experience**

ðŸ‘‹ Feel free to ask questions and customize your website as you code!

## Getting Set Up

First you need to setup your project. Linked below is a basic p5.js [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) that you can use to easily start coding.

1. Go to [https://replit.com/@AlexStrugacz1/Hersey-Hack-Club-Particle-Physics-Starter-Code?v=1](https://replit.com/@AlexStrugacz1/Hersey-Hack-Club-Particle-Physics-Starter-Code?v=1) 
2. Click "fork" to make a copy for you to edit


**If youâ€™ve finished early, there are some instructions below on how to add some cool features to the project!**

## You're Finished!

Click the green "Run" button at the top of the page. You should see some colorful particles moving!

And with that, you should now have a workingâ€”although very basicâ€”simulation of gravity between particles. This simulation is roughly what would happen in real life with these exact masses and distances. The values themselves are a bit over exaggerated to be more visually interesting.

- [Final Project](https://particle-physics.squarepear.repl.co/)

## What to Do Next?

Try changing some values and see how they affect the simulation. Add some extra features like creating a particle on click, anti-particles, or maybe apply this concept in a whole different way?

1. [Add on Click](https://repl.it/@SquarePear/Particle-Physics-Add-on-Click#sketch.js): Add a particle whenever you click on the canvas
2. [Anti-Particles](https://repl.it/@SquarePear/Particle-Physics-Anti-Particle#sketch.js): Anti-particles that repel other particles instead of attracting
3. [Physical Text](https://repl.it/@SquarePear/Particle-Physics-Text#sketch.js): Trace letters with particles
