# Particle Physics Live Workshop

In this workshop, you're going to use **p5.js**, along with ðŸŒŸ PHYSICS ðŸŒŸ, to animate colorful particles. Along the way, you'll learn a little bit about:

- how to use p5.js
- some basic physics concepts
- how *fun* creative coding is

All of the different particles will act like planets in orbit. They'll all apply forces (gravity) to each other depending on their mass and their distance from each other. 

- The main difference here is that they are much closer together than real planets. This is so you don't have to wait an entire year for one particle to orbit another.

**When you are done with this workshop, you should end up with something similar to this!**
