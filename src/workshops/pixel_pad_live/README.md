# Pixel Art Java Live Workshop

üïô This workshop will take one meetup.

üíª This workshop requires¬†**no prior coding experience.**

üñêÔ∏è Ask questions and customize your website as you code!

**In this workshop, you're going to use Java as a tool for creative coding in the web by coding your own pixel art pad.**

- JavaScript is a scripting language for adding functionality to websites, intended to be run in the browser; Java is a language intended for writing more complex applications, like desktop apps.

**Here's what the final art pad will look like:**

# Getting Started

## Setting Up Replit

We're going to be writing our code in an online code editor called¬†Replit. To get started, go to¬†[https://replit.com/@AlexStrugacz1/astrugacz-Pixel-Art-Pad-Starter-Code](https://replit.com/@AlexStrugacz1/astrugacz-Pixel-Art-Pad-Starter-Code) Your coding environment will be created in a few moments.

**Once you‚Äôve forked the starter code on replit, you are ready and set to begin!** 

## ‚≠ê¬†**Now we will complete the rest of the workshop live!**

*Head to the ‚ÄúHacking it!‚Äù section below once you‚Äôve completed the workshop for some cool ideas on how to add to the Pixel Pad!*

# Hacking it!

Take a few minutes to play around and make your own pixel art. Then share it with the rest of your club. Here are a few things I made:

Now that you've finished, make it your own! Here are a few things you could work on to expand this project:

- Add an erase feature
- Add a download button to download the pixel art as an image
- More colors or a custom color palette
- Custom CSS styles to make the color palette look more attractive
- Add a clear button to clear the drawing from the grid
