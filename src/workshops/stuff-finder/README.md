# Stuff Finder

Welcome to the stuff finder workshop! üëã

For the next few meetups, you‚Äôll build a custom ‚Äústuff finder website‚Äù! üî• This requires **no prior experience** & we'll provide tutorials for all features you'd like to add 

We‚Äôll first show you how to build a basic ice cream finder: \
\

\
Then, you‚Äôll be able to customize to your liking! \
\
For example, you can build:

‚Ä¢ Or anything else you'd like!\
\
These will all be posted to a **megasite** (collective site of everyone's stuff finders), so be creative & have fun with it!

\
‚Ä¢ We'll give more ideas & build support after you build the basics.

‚Ä¢ Alex and Miguel are open to helping at any time!

*Recommended setup ^^*

## Getting started **[üî®](https://emojipedia.org/hammer/)**

If you don‚Äôt have a replit account

‚Ä¢ Create an account on [repl.it](http://repl.it).\
‚Ä¢ Follow the instructions on the site & ask for help if needed

Once your account is set up, to get the starter code, go to  [https://replit.com/@MiguelAenlle1/Stuff-Finder?v=1](https://replit.com/@MiguelAenlle1/Stuff-Finder?v=1).

Click ‚ÄúFork Repl‚Äù on the right hand side as shown below to duplicate the starter code!

You should now be editing a copy of the starter code.

___

Let‚Äôs start by first adding an `<h1>` tag on the line after it says `YOUR CODE HERE`:

```html
<h1>Ice Cream Finder üç®</h1>
```

Under the `<h1>` tag, we‚Äôll then add a `<p>` tag right under for the description:

```html
<p>Best ice cream in the Chicago area!</p>
```

Let's now add some styling!

Go to `style.css` in the left-hand navigator:

![IceCreamFinder.gif](https://i.ibb.co/fDjZtm3/Ice-Cream-Finder.gif)

Once you‚Äôre there, add `font-family: sans-serif` to the `html, body` style as follows:


```css
html, body {
	height: 100%;
	width: 100%;
	font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

This will set the font of the webpage to `sans-serif` for all text!

___

Let's now add the cells. Go back to `index.html`

Then, type this code right under the `p` tag to start creating a found ice cream store cell:

```html
<div>
	<h3>1. Nutella Cafe</h3>
	<p>The ultimate ice cream</p>
</div>
```

Then, let‚Äôs add an image by inserting an `img` tag right over `h3`

```html
<div>
  <img src="my image"/>
	<h3>1. Nutella Cafe</h3>
	<p>The ultimate ice cream</p>
</div>
```

Replace `my image` with this link:

[https://i.ibb.co/ZGJwh4t/5beb41d748eb126c09037343.webp](https://i.ibb.co/ZGJwh4t/5beb41d748eb126c09037343.webp) ‚Äî an image of the Nutella Cafe.

It should now look like this:

![https://i.imgur.com/JJu2nIp.png](https://i.imgur.com/JJu2nIp.png)

Obviously not the best formatting üòÇ

So let‚Äôs go back to `style.css` to add a better format!

Let‚Äôs start by creating a style class for `cell` by adding

```html
.cell {

}
```

Right under the last bracket of `html, body { ... }`

Your code should now look like this:

![https://i.imgur.com/OhsSVNW.png](https://i.imgur.com/OhsSVNW.png)

In cell, let‚Äôs add this CSS to style it up:

```css
.cell {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

‚Ä¢ `background-color` will change it to the background `#f2f2f2` (a light gray)\
‚Ä¢ `padding: 10px` adds 10 pixels of padding to the cell, making content look better.

Now, go back to `index.html` and see the site:

![https://i.imgur.com/DP5wqKq.png](https://i.imgur.com/DP5wqKq.png)

One last step for the changes to apply! 

Type `class="cell"` in the cell‚Äôs div to tell `CSS` *********which********* `div` should have the styling applied to it:

![https://i.imgur.com/BuUNwgi.png](https://i.imgur.com/BuUNwgi.png)

You should now see the gray background on the cell:

![https://i.imgur.com/12XrCtq.png](https://i.imgur.com/12XrCtq.png)

Let‚Äôs now make the image better!

Go back to `style.css`

Then, a few lines under `.cell` ‚Äôs last bracket, add `.cell img {}` like this:

![https://i.imgur.com/8LRQsuT.png](https://i.imgur.com/8LRQsuT.png)

This applies whatever CSS we put within the brackets to any `img` tag inside a div of class `cell`.

Now, add this code within the `.cell img` brackets to format the image:

```css
.cell img {
	width: 100%,
  height: 150px
}
```

This will resize the image into the cell:

![https://i.imgur.com/2OwUpZr.png](https://i.imgur.com/2OwUpZr.png)

Problem: the image is super stretched! Let‚Äôs fix that by adding this to `.cell img`

```css
object-fit: cover
```

So your `.cell img {}` should now look like this:

```css
.cell img {
	width: 100%,
  height: 150px,
  object-fit: cover
}
```

You should now have a site that looks like this:

### Add a second ice cream store

Before you start customizing, try adding a second ice cream store!

Your goal is to make the site look like this:

You can use any name and description ‚Äî

### Let‚Äôs get hacking!

In this section, your challenge is to add additional features to the ‚Äústuff‚Äù finder to make it your own!
