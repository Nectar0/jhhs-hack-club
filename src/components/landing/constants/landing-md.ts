[**Hack Club**](${hackclubLink} "Hack Club Website"), JHHS Hack Club‚Äôs parent organization, is a global network of 2,000+ coding clubs where students collaborate on projects, workshops, build hackathons, and more!

**JHHS Hack Club** is a branch of Hack Club built for JHHS.

Instead of hacking into banks or Discord servers, ‚Äúhacking‚Äù refers to building: building things we love.

export const areWeHacking = `
Don't worry -- we're not hacking into banks or Discord servers!
\n &nbsp;
\n
Hacking can also describe the process of building something from scratch. It's a way of thinking that can be applied to any project, whether it's a website, a game, or a robot.
\n &nbsp;
\n
So instead of hacking for bad, we hack for good! We build things that we love and share them with the world.
