Don't worry -- we're not hacking into banks or Discord servers!

Hacking can also describe the process of building something from scratch. It's a way of thinking that can be applied to any project, whether it's a website, a game, or a robot.
\n &nbsp;
\n
So instead of hacking for bad, we hack for good! We build things that we love and share them with the world.

If you're more advanced, workshops have more advanced topics covered & code challenges you can try out!
